# Book Search Engine

## Description
A MERN stack Google Books API search engine that was built with a RESTful API that I then refactored to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. After you sign up/login as a user, you can search for books and then save and delete them as you please.

## Installation
If you would like to run this locally, first download the code. Navigate to the root directory of the downloaded code in your preferred shell, make sure you have a package manager such as NPM installed, and then run "npm run install". After all dependencies have installed, run "npm run start" to start the application, and a browser window will open momentarily with the web application.

## Usage
You'll find the login/sign up button in the top right of the screen - use the appropriate tab in the modal to login or create an account. After you are logged in with an account, you can save searched books. Click the See Your Books link in the top right of the screen to view and delete your saved books.
